# Model Evaluation on Classification Models

This project demonstrates **model evaluation techniques** for classification models using standard metrics and visualizations.  
The goal is to assess the performance of machine learning models and understand their strengths and weaknesses through various evaluation methods.

## 📚 Dataset

- **Source**: Sample datasets from `sklearn.datasets` or other CSV-based inputs
- Typical classification problems such as binary or multiclass prediction tasks

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

✅ Load and preprocess data  
✅ Train multiple classification models  
✅ Evaluate using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC  
✅ Visualize results with Confusion Matrix, ROC, and Precision-Recall Curves
