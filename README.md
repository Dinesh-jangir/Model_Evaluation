📊 Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning
This repository contains scripts and notebooks for evaluating different machine learning models using popular metrics and validation techniques. The goal is to analyze model performance thoroughly and support better model selection for real-world applications.

🚀 Features
Evaluation of classification and regression models

Use of metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC, MAE, RMSE, and R²

Confusion Matrix & ROC Curve visualizations

Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning

Clean and modular code for reproducibility
